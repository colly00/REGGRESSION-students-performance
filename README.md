## 📖 Overview

Educational institutions are increasingly interested in using data to improve student outcomes. This project applies machine learning to predict a student's performance (e.g., expected score or grade) based on behavioral and academic data using regression algorithms.

You can also interact with the model using a simple Streamlit dashboard.
